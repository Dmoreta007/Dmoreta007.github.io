<h2 style="text-align:right;">Cam will be taking his Journey across the jungle to get to a town after being left stranded after a plane crash on the way to Asia. He was terrified the whole trip there, the whole day felt wrong and 2 hours into the trip the engines started falling and the plane went down and left no survivors but him. He wakes up after being unconscious for a few minutes in the middle of the dense jungle where there is danger at every corner. He encounters many animals on his way out, some are friendly, some not, but he can't stop because the night is approaching and he thinks he won't make it through the night so he never stops. After a long and sweaty day he finds a town riddled with people and runs towards them with excitement knowing that he had finally made it when all signs lead to his end.</h2>
